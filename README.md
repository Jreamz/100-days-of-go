# 100-days-of-go

This is my 2026 journey to learn Go. I've been dabbling with Go for the past year off and on and want to fully
commit and deeply focus on the language. I have a decent amount of experience with Python, but I'm looking to expand my
knowledge of programming and need to step outside my comfort zone.

I will be using a few structured resources (Udemy course, Exercism and Learn Go with Tests), as I find it suits my learning 
style best. I will update my resources used here as I go. While I may use Claude AI a little bit, I will be focusing on 
NOT leaning on AI to help me learn and focusing on a deep, hands-on, arguably "legacy" style of learning. I truly think 
leaning on AI too much is detrimental to your learning, so I will be trying to avoid it except to unblock myself or ask 
for feedback or understanding. I will not be committing or leveraging any AI-generated code.

## Day 1
Yesterday was mainly focused on purchasing the video course from Udemy and starting the first chapter. This is mainly
an introduction to the language, history, why it was developed and other philosophical aspects — completed section 1
and section 2. I also simply followed some examples in the `Learn go with Tests` written guide. Along with setting up Goland,
Ubuntu and my personal local dev env.

## Day 2
I could likely skip some of these introductory sections, but I'm committed to going through every section, even if it's just a refresher

Setup this github repo and continued on the Udemy course material:
- Raw string literals in Golang https://go.dev/ref/spec#String_literals
- UTF-8 encoding. The progression of ASCII to Unicode to UTF-8
- **Very** basic hands on exercise, using the `fmt` package to print some string literals and some text with emojis lol
- Another **very** basic exercise, using the `fmt.Printf` to print out some values in binary and hexidecimal format
- Reviewing variables, types, zero values, and blank identifiers

## Day 3
- Reviewing numeral systems: decimal, binary & hexadecimal
- Reviewed values, types, conversion and scope
- Reviewed built-in/primitive/basic types, aggregate (e.g. array, slice, map) and composite types (e.g. struct)
- Completed exercises 1-10 from [A Tour of Go](go.dev/tour/)

## Day 4
- Completed exercises 10-17 from [A Tour of Go](go.dev/tour/)
- This covered more on basic types, zero values, scope for variables/constants, implicit types, type conversion, type inference
bitwise operations
- Simple hands on exercise to visualize bitwise operations


## Day 5
- Reading effective go docs and wiki on `iota` which is an auto-incrementing constant generator that resets
on each new `const` block. A light day, but this took a bit longer than I expected. Haven't used something like iota
in Python before.

## Day 6
- Udemy course hands on # 9: more on iota, measurings bits, bitwise operations
- Super light day, only took about ~20 minutes
