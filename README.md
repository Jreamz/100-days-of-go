# 100-days-of-go

This is my 2026 journey to learn Go. I've been dabbling with Go for the past year off and on and want to fully
commit and deeply focus on the language.

I will be using a few structure resources, as I find it suites my learning style best. I will update my resources used
here as I go.

## Day 1
Yesterday was mainly focused on purchasing the video course from Udemy and starting the first chapter. This is mainly
an introduction to the language, history, why it was developed and other philosophical aspects — completed section 1
and section 2. I also simple followed some examples in the learn go with tests introduction.

## Day 2
Setup this github repo and continued on the Udemy course material.
